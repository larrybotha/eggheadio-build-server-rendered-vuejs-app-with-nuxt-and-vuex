Learning and annotations from https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-vue-js-app-with-nuxt-and-vuex

Lessons are represented by branches.

Didn't complete this course - not really interested in Nuxt working with it in
this course.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
